# My top OS learning materials

These materials guide me through my past OS assignments and help me to learn them better.\
I hope you can find them  helpful (too)! :).

## Week 01

### [OS101 Playlist](https://youtu.be/vBURTt97EkA)
This playlist is provided by Neso Academy. It dives really deep into the heart of the OS subject, starting from the ground zero (its definition).\
The way the tutor teaches really suit my learning pace and that's why you'll find it on top of my list.

### [AWK for Dummies](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/awk/index.htm)
As the title suggests, this tutorial will walk you through the most detailed AWK tutorial that i've ever found.\
It separates all the core concepts into its own subsection so all of you will have an easy time navigating through this site! 

## Week 02

### [C Programming Tutorials Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRggZZgYpPMUxdY1CYkZtARR)
This playlist also created and provided by Neso Academy. It consists of 169 videos and each of them is enriched with crystal clear explanations & guides.

### [SHA-256 in Layman Terms](https://www.quora.com/What-is-SHA-256)
Creating SHA-256 is a mandatory task on Week 2 of our OS journey. This quora discussion explains it with simple terms and that's why i put it on my favorite links.
 
### [Cybersecurity Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-cybersecurity)
Cybersecurity plays a very vital role on our society. It secures all of the sensitive informations online from future potential hacker.\
As the reason why i recommend this certain course is because it was made by Codecademy, one of my favorite online course out there.
