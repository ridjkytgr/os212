Process Synchronization is the task of coordinating the execution of processes in a way that no two processes can have access to the same shared data and resources. A critical section is a segment of code which can be accessed by a signal process at a specific point of time. The solution to Critical Section problem is called Semaphore Solution. Semaphore is simply a variable that is non-negative and shared between threads.

## Week 08

### [Guide to LFS by Sudo Tech](https://youtu.be/8WsDcW5SQ9Y)
