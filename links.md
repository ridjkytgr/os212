# My top OS learning materials

These materials guide me through my past OS assignments and help me to learn it better.\
I hope you can find it helpful (too)! :).\

### [OS101 Playlist](https://youtu.be/vBURTt97EkA)\
This playlist is  provided by Neso Academy. It dives really deep into the heart of the OS subject, starting from the ground zero (its definition).\
The way the tutor teaches really suit my learning pace and that's why you'll find it on top of my list.
